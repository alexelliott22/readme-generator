  ## Description
  This project creates a random password for the user after the user answers a few prompts such as "How many charaters?", "Do you want lowercase letters?", "Do you want uppercase letters?", and "Do you want special characters?". Then a random password is generated based on their answers to those prompts. The user may generate as many passwords as they like.
